# Panda Run
PWA city quiz built with `React` as a view library and `storeon` as state manager

## Installation & usage
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run start` to launch application on `port=3000`

- you are ready to go!

## How it works

Application consists of a sequence of dynamic screens:
1. **Start screen**, where the greeting is displayed
2. **Game screen**, which has the question block and radar that tracks player's geoposition
3. **Finish screen** with success message
